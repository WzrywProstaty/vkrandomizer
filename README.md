# vkrandomizer
Just a mass of code that I wrote in 2020 for my VK chat bot that would randomize cyrillic text with latin symbols to avoid massive copypasting that puts you into spam-list. Also this bot contains code that can randomize your image - randomly rotate by - 0-1.5 degree and apply a random filter
